    "The SDK has very few primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent** — An LLM equipped with `instructions`, `tools`, and `handoffs`.\n",
    "- **Runner** — Executes an agent loop: sends user input → LLM decides → calls tools / hands off → repeats until done.\n",
    "- **Function tools** — Turn any Python function into a tool the LLM can call (schema is auto-generated).\n",
    "- **Handoffs** — Let an agent transfer control to another agent.\n",
    "- **Agents as tools** — Let a central \"orchestrator\" agent call sub-agents as tools without fully handing off control.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Principle | Why |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Separate agents from tools** | Agents are *configuration* (instructions, model, handoffs). Tools are *logic*. Keep them apart so you can test tools independently. |\n",
    "| **One agent per file** | Makes it easy to find, update, and version-control each agent's prompt and behavior. |\n",
    "| **Group tools by domain** | `order_tools.py`, `billing_tools.py` — each file contains related tools. Easier to maintain. |\n",
    "| **Pydantic models in `models/`** | Define your data shapes once, reuse in tools and handoff inputs. |\n",
    "| **Services layer** | Real database queries and API calls go here. Tools call services, not the other way around. |\n",
    "| **Config in one place** | Load `.env`, set model names, default temperatures, etc. in `config.py`. |\n",
    "| **Test your tools** | Tool functions are pure Python — easy to unit test. Test that `get_order_status(\"ORD-001\")` returns the right thing. |\n",
